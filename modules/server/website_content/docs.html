        <div class="title"> File description </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p> All files user has in their storage are shown in the appropriate box,
                which could be easily recongnised by its title. </p>
            <p> For example, a file, with a name 'my_file.csv' would look like this.</p>
            <div class="example"></div>


            <p> If you <b>click</b> on the file, you will get all the information about it.</p>
            <p> This current file, as you can see yourself, has <b>pages</b> info (which are
            always the first thing, that is parsed and also <b> coordinates </b>. The
            coordiantes are required for the file to be displayed on map </p>
            <p> To open it on map - you just press the <b>'Open on map'</b> button.</p>
            <div class="example"></div>
            <p> The other 2 parameters are <b>authors</b> - which correspond to information about
            revision authors and <b>timestamp</b>, which is the time a page was created. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Now you can try displaying description with the file from the first example. </p>
            <p> Note, that if you open the map, an error will be displayed, notifing that this file
            does not exist. </p>

            <p> Finally, files also have buttons near them, which allows you to either add them or
            remove from the list of selected for processing files.</p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
                <div class="example" style="margin-left: 20px"></div>
                <div class="example" style="margin-left: 20px"></div>
            </div>
            <p> You can try adding and removing from the second box in the example above. </p>
            <p> The second box corresponds to <b> Selected for processing files </b> in controls. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="title"> Creating new files with data </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p> Before displaying anything on the map - you need to collect the data.
                This is how it all works - at first you need to get <b>ids</b> of all the required
                pages. This is done with a 'allpages' request to Wikipedia. Then - once you
                have a way to identify page, you can all the other required information about it.
                So then the requests for the <b>content, user or timestamp</b> are sent for each <b>pageid</b>
                gathered before.</p>
            <p> WikiNG has made the parsing process easy - all you have to do is press a button. </p>
            <div class="note"> <p>Calling python terminal browser works on <b> Windows </b> using the default terminal well,
                but may not work properly on Linux and MacOS. </p> <p> If for some reason it does not work, you can
                call the required functions directly through <b>Python</b> - it is just as easy.</p> </div>

            <div class="title important"> Getting all the pages </div>
            <p> The controls you will get will look something like this: </p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="title"> Get new Data </div>
                <form class="controls">
                    <div class="horizontal">
                        <label> Language: <input id="languageInput" type=text value="uk"> </label>
                    </div>
                    <div class="horizontal">
                        <p> Action: </p>
                        <div id="actionInputs">
                            <label><input name="actionInput" type="radio" checked> Get page titles and ids </label>
                            <label><input name="actionInput" type="radio"> Get coordinates </label>
                            <label><input name="actionInput" type="radio"> Get revision authors & timestamps </label>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="horizontal" id="fileFromDiv">
                        <label style="margin-bottom: 0"> File from: <input type=text disabled value="None"> </label>
                    </div>
                    <div class="horizontal" id="fileToDiv">
                        <label style="margin-top: 0"> File to: <input type=text id="toInput" disabled value="uk_pages.csv"> </label>
                    </div>
                    <div class="horizontal"> <button> Submit </button> </div>
                </form>
            </div>
            <p> The first thing you need to choose is the <b>language</b> - this is a string of 2 letters,
                that represents a language in Wikipedia. If you do not know the code for a language you need,
                just open Wikipedia in the corresponding language and look at the link.
                For example: https://<b>uk</b>.wikipedia.org - has the language code in it: uk (Ukrainian).</p>
            <p> In the radio buttons list, we choose <b> Get page titles and ids</b>, cos that is exactly what we need.</p>
            <p> The <b>File from</b> should be None and the <b>File to</b> will correspond to the file, it
                all will be saved to. </p>
            <p> All that you need to do now is press submit! <br>... And wait till the data is collected.</p>

            <div class="title important"> Getting coordinates </div>
            <p> Now, that you have collected the pages, we need to get somthing to display on the map -
                the coordinates.</p>
            <p> As mentioned previously, you first need to select a file - a file with <b>pageids</b>, for which we
                will collect coordinates. So, you most likely will just select the file <b>XX_pages.csv</b> you have just collected </p>
            <p> The second thing you need to do is change the <b> Action </b> to <b> Get coordinates </b>, which just makes a lot
                of sense </p>
            <p> Now the <b> File from </b> should be the selected file and the <b> File to </b> should be a new file with
                coordinates. </p>
            <div class="note"> The language of the <b> File to </b> will be the same, as the <b> File from </b>
                and the language input does not change anything. </div>
            <p> Now - submit.</p>

            <div class="title important"> Getting revisions </div>
            <p> To get the revision and timestamps, just perform the same actions, as with collection coordinates, but
                select <b> Get revision authors & timestamps </b> this time </p>
        </div>

        <div class="title"> Clearing coordinates </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p> Suppose, we have collected all the pages and parsed the coordinates for them. But, as you might have
                guessed, not every page has geographic coordinates corresponding to it. That is where clearing
                coordinates comes into place. </p>
            <p> It looks through all the pages and removes those, that do not have coordinates - and saves it all
                into a new file. </p>
            <p> The controls look something like this: </p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="title"> Change existing file </div>
                <div class="controls">
                    <div class="horizontal">
                        <label style="margin-bottom: 0"> File: <input type=text disabled value="myFile.csv"> </label>
                    </div>
                    <button style="width: 200px;""> Clear coordinates </button>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> This makes the file smaller, so it will load faster and the program will process it faster.</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p> If you clear the coordinates and then select the cleared file and get revisions for it,
                    you might save some time, as you won't need to get revisions for pages without coordinates.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="title"> Merging files </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p> Now, that you have collected all the data you need, you will have 2 separate files with most important
                data: <b>XX_coordinates.csv</b> and <b> XX_revisions.csv </b> (or with some other names - but one
                having the coordinates and one with revisions. </p>
            <p> The problem is they are separated and you can't display them at the same time. </p>
            <p> But you can merge them. Just select both files and then press the merge button. A new file (like
                <b>XX_all_data.csv</b>) will be created.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="title"> Merge files </div>
                <div class="controls">
                    <button style="width: 200px;"> Merge all files </button>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p> Now open your new file and enjoy the map of Wikipedia with all its features.</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p> This feature can also be used to combine files, that both have the same type of data, but
                    different pages. For example, you can merge files with pages from Ukrainian and English
                    Wikipedia versions. Now, both of them can be displayed at the same time on map (But won't
                    be able to distinguish them).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="title"> Unfinished files </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p> Sometimes you do not have enough time to collect all the data in one session. Luckily, you
                you can just press <b> Ctrl+C </b>, the parsing will stop and all the data will be saved. </p>
            <p> WikiNG also performs automatic saves after a certain number of requests have been sent. So, if
                for some reason, the program is not closed properly, you can return to a recent state and continue
                collecting data. </p>
            <div class="note"> <p> If you just close the terminal and not with pressing <b> Ctrl+C </b>, the current data won't be
                saved. However, you will still be able to return to an autosafe performed previously. </p> </div>
            <p> The files, which weren't finished parsing will have a slighly red background, so you can
                easily distinguish them. Their description will also have information about data, that is still
                required to be parsed. </p>
            <div class="example"></div>
                <p> The 2 files on top are not finished. The <b> count </b> represents the number of requests,
                    that have already been sent. The <b> pages now </b> and <b> pages max </b> represent the current and
                    the required number of pages to be parsed. They are only available for coordinates and revisions.</p>
                <p> To continue parsing files, you will need to send the request for the same file again. (The parameters
                    in controls should be the same and <b> file to </b> should be the unfinished file). </p>
            <div class="note"> <p> You <b>can open</b> unfinished files <b>on map</b>. This won't change them in any way and they
                    will still be available for further data collection after this.</p>
                <p> But, it is <b>not recommended</b> to use those files to <b>create new files</b> (like get coordinates from unfinished
                        pages file. This may result in errors and incomplete data. </p></div>
